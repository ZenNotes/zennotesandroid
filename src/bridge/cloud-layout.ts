/**
 * Physical-layout reconciliation for "Open on this device" (#17).
 *
 * Cloud sync mirrors vault-relative paths verbatim — it has no notion of
 * primary-notes mode. A fresh Android vault keeps its notes under `inbox/`,
 * while most desktop-created vaults keep them at the vault root, so linking
 * one to the other used to merge two parallel trees: the device's
 * `inbox/Daily Notes` and the cloud's `Daily Notes` both classify as the
 * inbox subpath "Daily Notes" (folderForRelativePath), and every daily note
 * showed up twice.
 *
 * Before the first sync of a newly linked vault, this module reads the cloud
 * vault's manifest (paths only, no content), infers which layout the cloud
 * tree uses, and moves the local vault's primary notes to match. The move is
 * invisible in the app — `inbox/X` and root `X` render identically — but it
 * makes the first sync merge one tree instead of two.
 *
 * Known limit: a cloud vault whose inbox was remapped (`systemFolderPaths`)
 * and that has no literal `inbox/` directory reads as root-mode here, because
 * the manifest listing carries no settings content. That combination requires
 * deliberate desktop configuration and self-corrects once the settings
 * conflict is resolved; the common shapes (fresh device joining a desktop
 * root vault, or two default vaults) reconcile exactly.
